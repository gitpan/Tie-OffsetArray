NAME
     Tie::OffsetArray -	Tie one	array to another, with index
     offset

SYNOPSIS
       use Tie::OffsetArray;

       tie @a, 'Tie::OffsetArray', 1, \@b; # offset=1; use given array.

       tie @c, 'Tie::OffsetArray', 2;	   # use anonymous array.

       $a[0] = 'x';			   # assign to $b[1];

       tied(@a)->array->[0] = 'y';	   # assign to $b[0].


DESCRIPTION
     When tied to this class, an array's behavior is completely
     normal.  For its internal storage,	it uses	another	array,
     either one	supplied by the	caller,	or a new anonymous one.
     Accesses to the tied array	are mapped down	to the storage
     array by offsetting the index by some constant amount.

     A special method on the tied object returns a reference to
     the storage array,	so that	the elements below the offset can
     be	accessed.  This	is particularly	useful if the storage
     array was not supplied by the caller.
